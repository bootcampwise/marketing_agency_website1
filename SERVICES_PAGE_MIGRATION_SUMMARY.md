# Services Page Migration Summary

## What Was Done

I've successfully analyzed the services page and migrated it to use Prismic CMS, following the same pattern as the homepage.

## Files Created/Modified

### Custom Types
- **`customtypes/services_page/index.json`** - Custom type definition for the services page

### Slices
1. **`slices/ServicesHero/`**
   - `model.json` - Slice definition for hero section
   - `index.tsx` - React component

2. **`slices/ServiceCard/`**
   - `model.json` - Slice definition for individual service cards
   - `index.tsx` - React component with full styling logic

3. **`slices/ServicesCta/`**
   - `model.json` - Slice definition for CTA section
   - `index.tsx` - React component

### Updated Files
- **`slices/index.ts`** - Added new slices to the registry
- **`app/services/page.tsx`** - Converted to use Prismic SliceZone

### Documentation
- **`SERVICES_PAGE_SETUP_GUIDE.md`** - Comprehensive setup guide

## Structure Analysis

The original services page had:

### 1. Hero Section
- Title: "Our Services"
- Description paragraph

### 2. Six Service Cards
Each service card includes:
- **Badge** with two lines of text
- **Illustration** image
- **Background color** (gray, green, dark, or light)
- **Optional wrapper** for some cards
- **"What we offer"** description
- **CTA button** with text and link
- **Benefits list** (4 items per service)

The six services are:
1. SEO (Search Engine Optimization)
2. PPC (Pay-per-click advertising)
3. Social Media Marketing
4. Email Marketing
5. Content Creation
6. Analytics and Tracking

### 3. CTA Section
- Heading
- Description
- Button linking to contact page

## How It Works

### Data Flow
1. **Prismic CMS** stores all content
2. **Custom Type** (`services_page`) defines the page structure
3. **Slices** define reusable content blocks
4. **SliceZone** renders the slices dynamically
5. **React Components** render each slice with proper styling

### Styling
All original styling has been preserved:
- Tailwind CSS classes
- Border styles with `border-2 border-b-8`
- Rounded corners `rounded-[45px]`
- Color variations (gray, green, dark, light)
- Responsive grid layouts
- Hover effects and transitions

## Next Steps

1. **Run Slice Machine**
   ```bash
   npm run slicemachine
   ```

2. **Push to Prismic**
   - Click "Push to Prismic" in Slice Machine
   - This will sync the custom type and slices

3. **Create Content**
   - Go to Prismic dashboard
   - Create a new "Services Page" document
   - Add slices and populate with content
   - Follow the detailed guide in `SERVICES_PAGE_SETUP_GUIDE.md`

4. **Publish**
   - Save and publish the document

5. **Verify**
   - Visit `/services` to see the Prismic-powered page

## Benefits

✅ **Content Management** - Easy to update services without touching code
✅ **Flexibility** - Add, remove, or reorder services through Prismic
✅ **Consistency** - Same pattern as homepage
✅ **SEO** - Proper metadata management
✅ **Type Safety** - TypeScript types (will be generated by Slice Machine)
✅ **Maintainability** - Separated content from presentation

## TypeScript Note

The slice components currently use `any` type for props. Once you run Slice Machine and push to Prismic, the proper TypeScript types will be generated in `prismicio-types.d.ts`. You can then update the type annotations if desired, but it will work fine as-is.

## Troubleshooting

If you see a yellow warning box on the services page, it means:
- The Prismic document hasn't been created yet
- Follow the setup guide to create and publish the content

The page includes helpful error messages and instructions if content is missing.
